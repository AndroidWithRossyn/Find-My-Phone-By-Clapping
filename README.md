 # Find My Phone By Clapping:
1. Clap Detection:
Simply tap on the app's switch to activate the clapping detection feature. Once activated, the app utilizes the microphone of your phone to listen for specific clapping patterns. When you clap your hands, the app will respond by triggering a specific action, such as making a sound or flashing the flashlight, helping you locate your phone quickly and effortlessly.

2. Sound Options:
The app offers a wide range of sound options that can be triggered by clapping. From simple beeps to melodious tunes or even custom recorded sounds, you can choose the sound that resonates with you the most. This feature allows for personalized and enjoyable phone finding experiences.

3. Flashlight and Vibration:
In addition to sound, the app provides a flashlight and vibration option. When you clap to find your phone, the flashlight will turn on, illuminating the surroundings and making it easier to locate your device in dark or dimly lit areas. Simultaneously, the phone will vibrate, providing tactile feedback that helps you identify the phone's location even in noisy environments.

4. Call Response:
If someone calls your phone while it is misplaced, the app offers call response functionalities to assist you in locating it. As soon as the phone receives an incoming call, the app will automatically activate the vibration mode, causing the phone to vibrate. Additionally, the flashlight will start blinking, making it visually noticeable. These features enable you to locate your phone quickly, even if it is on silent or in a different room.
